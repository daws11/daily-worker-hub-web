=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Database Schema & RLS Policies
Workspace: /Users/yanuar/Documents/daws/daily-worker-hub-web/.auto-claude/worktrees/tasks/004-database-schema-rls-policies
Started: 2026-02-22

Workflow Type: migration
Rationale: Database schema setup follows a migration pattern: (1) Prepare migration files and directory structure, (2) Execute schema creation with tables, RLS policies, and indexes, (3) Cleanup with verification and seed data.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Created project_index.json
- Created context.json
- Phases: 5
- Total subtasks: 24
- Created init.sh

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Prepare Migration Structure): 2 subtasks, depends on []
  - Create Supabase migration directory structure
  - Create initial schema migration file with core tables
- Phase 2 (Create Database Schema): 9 subtasks, depends on [phase-1-prepare]
  - Create enum types for job_status and booking_status
  - Create users table with auth integration
  - Create workers and businesses tables with user relationships
  - Create skills and categories tables
  - Create jobs and jobs_skills junction table
  - Create bookings table with business/worker/job relationships
  - Create transactions table for payments
  - Create messages, reviews, and notifications tables
  - Create reports and webhooks tables
- Phase 3 (Implement RLS Policies): 7 subtasks, depends on [phase-2-execute]
  - Enable RLS and create policies for users table
  - Create RLS policies for workers table
  - Create RLS policies for businesses table
  - Create RLS policies for jobs table
  - Create RLS policies for bookings table
  - Create RLS policies for transactions table
  - Create RLS policies for reviews, messages, notifications tables
- Phase 4 (Create Indexes): 2 subtasks, depends on [phase-3-security]
  - Create indexes for foreign key columns
  - Create indexes for status and timestamp columns
- Phase 5 (Create Seed Data and Verify): 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-4-performance]
  - Create seed data file with test data
  - Create Supabase config file if needed
  - Verify schema matches TypeScript types
  - Test migration with Supabase CLI

Services Involved:
- database: PostgreSQL schema with RLS policies

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 1
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups: None (sequential execution - each phase depends on previous)

=== INVESTIGATION FINDINGS ===

Project Type: Next.js 14 + Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- TypeScript types already defined in lib/supabase/types.ts
- No SQL migrations exist yet
- Documentation references supabase/schema.sql (not created)

Tables Required (from types.ts):
1. users - User profiles with role (worker/business)
2. workers - Worker-specific data (skills, location, bio)
3. businesses - Business-specific data
4. skills - Skill lookup table
5. categories - Job categories
6. jobs - Job postings from businesses
7. jobs_skills - Junction table for job-skill relationships
8. bookings - Worker bookings for jobs
9. transactions - Payment transactions
10. messages - User-to-user messaging
11. reviews - Worker reviews from businesses
12. notifications - User notifications
13. reports - User/content reports
14. webhooks - Webhook configurations

Tech Stack:
- Database: PostgreSQL 15+
- Migration Tool: Supabase CLI
- Security: Row Level Security (RLS)
- Auth: Supabase Auth (GoTrue)
- API: PostgREST (via Supabase)

=== KEY PATTERNS ===

Table Naming:
- Plural table names (users, workers, businesses, jobs, bookings)

ID Pattern:
- All tables use UUID primary keys with default gen_random_uuid()

Timestamp Pattern:
- created_at and updated_at columns on all tables

RLS Pattern:
- All tables require RLS policies for security
- Users can only access their own data
- Public can read verified workers/businesses
- Admins have full access

Foreign Key Pattern:
- Foreign keys use ON DELETE CASCADE for cleanup

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec:

1. Start Supabase:
   cd /Users/yanuar/Documents/daws/daily-worker-hub-web/.auto-claude/worktrees/tasks/004-database-schema-rls-policies
   bash .auto-claude/specs/004-database-schema-rls-policies/init.sh

2. Next coder agent will:
   - Read implementation_plan.json for subtask list
   - Find next pending subtask (respecting dependencies)
   - Implement the actual code changes
   - Update subtask status after completion

=== END SESSION 1 ===

PLANNER AGENT - Planning Complete
DO NOT implement any code. Coder agent will handle implementation.

=== SESSION 2 - CODING ===

[2026-02-22] Subtask 1-1: Create Supabase migration directory structure
Status: COMPLETED
Changes:
  - Created supabase/migrations/ directory structure
  - Updated .gitignore to track migrations while ignoring other Supabase files
  - Added .gitkeep to ensure empty migrations directory is tracked
Commit: efc949d - auto-claude: subtask-1-1 - Create Supabase migration directory structure

[2026-02-22] Subtask 1-2: Create initial schema migration file with core tables

Status: COMPLETED
Changes:
  - Workers and businesses tables already properly defined in migration
  - Both tables have user_id foreign key references with CASCADE delete
  - UNIQUE(user_id) constraint ensures one-to-one relationship
  - Location indexes (lat, lng) for geo-queries
  - update_businesses_updated_at and update_workers_updated_at triggers

  - Skills table: id (UUID), name (TEXT UNIQUE), slug (TEXT UNIQUE), created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
  - Categories table: id (UUID), name (TEXT UNIQUE), slug (TEXT UNIQUE), created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
