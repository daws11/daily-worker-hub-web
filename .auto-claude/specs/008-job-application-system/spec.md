# Job Application System

One-tap job application system for workers. Workers can apply for jobs, see their application status, and cancel applications before acceptance. Businesses receive real-time notifications for new applications.

## Rationale
Simple application flow reduces friction for workers and increases job fill rates. Real-time notifications keep businesses engaged and reduce time-to-hire.

## User Stories
- As a worker, I want to apply for jobs with one tap so that I can quickly find work

- As a worker, I want to cancel applications so that I don't double-book myself

- [ ] Businesses receive notifications for new applications
