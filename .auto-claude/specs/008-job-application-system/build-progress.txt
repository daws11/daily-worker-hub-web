=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Job Application System
Workspace: managed by orchestrator (worktree mode)
Started: 2026-02-22

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Building a new multi-service feature (frontend + database) with clear dependencies.
           Database layer must be implemented first, then server actions, followed by UI
           components, and finally integration.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 6
- Total subtasks: 16
- Created init.sh
- Created context files (project_index.json, context.json)

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 - Database Schema & Migrations: 2 subtasks, depends on []
- Phase 2 - Server Actions & API Layer: 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-1-database]
- Phase 3 - UI Components: 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-2-server-actions]
- Phase 4 - Worker Dashboard: 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-3-ui-components]
- Phase 5 - Business Dashboard: 2 subtasks, depends on [phase-3-ui-components]
- Phase 6 - Integration & Notifications: 2 subtasks, depends on [phase-4-worker-dashboard, phase-5-business-dashboard]

Services Involved:
- frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Supabase

Key Findings from Investigation:
- Existing bookings table has status field (pending/accepted/rejected) for applications
- Existing notifications table for user notifications
- Auth pattern: Context provider with Supabase client-side auth
- UI: shadcn/ui components available, inline styling used
- Toast: Sonner for notifications
- Current dashboard pages are placeholders

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2 (Phase 4 and Phase 5 can run in parallel)
- Recommended workers: 1 (Sequential execution recommended - shared state management)
- Parallel groups:
  * Phase 4 (Worker Dashboard) + Phase 5 (Business Dashboard) can run in parallel

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  npm run dev

Or use the init script:

  bash .auto-claude/specs/008-job-application-system/init.sh

=== END SESSION 1 ===

Session 2 (2026-02-22):
- subtask-1-1: COMPLETED - Added unique constraint to prevent duplicate job applications
- subtask-1-2: COMPLETED - Created RLS policies for bookings table
  * File: supabase/migrations/20260222_add_bookings_rls_policies.sql
  * Worker policies: view, create, and update own bookings
  * Business policies: view and update bookings for their jobs
  * Admin policies: full access for auditing
  * Workers can only cancel pending bookings
- subtask-2-1: COMPLETED - Created job application server actions
  * File: lib/actions/job-applications.ts
  * Functions: applyForJob, cancelApplication, checkDuplicateApplication
  * Additional: getWorkerApplications, getJobApplicants, acceptApplication, rejectApplication
  * All actions include proper error handling and type safety

=== CURRENT STATUS ===
Phase 1 (Database Schema & Migrations): 2/2 subtasks completed
Phase 2 (Server Actions & API Layer): 1/3 subtasks completed
Next: Phase 2 - Server Actions & API Layer (subtask-2-2)
