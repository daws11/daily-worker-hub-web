=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Job Completion & Payment Release
Workspace: .auto-claude/worktrees/tasks/017-job-completion-payment-release
Started: 2025-02-22

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Multi-service feature requiring database schema changes, backend business logic (server actions), and UI components. Involves multiple tables (bookings, wallets, transactions) and flows (checkout -> payment hold -> review -> release).

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Created project_index.json
- Created context.json
- Phases: 6
- Total subtasks: 22
- Created init.sh

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Database Schema & RLS Policies): 3 subtasks, depends on []
- Phase 2 (Wallet System Backend): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-1-database]
- Phase 3 (Checkout & Payment Release Backend): 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-2-backend-wallet]
- Phase 4 (Checkout UI Components): 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-3-backend-checkout]
- Phase 5 (Wallet UI Components): 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-2-backend-wallet]
- Phase 6 (Integration & End-to-End Testing): 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-4-frontend-checkout, phase-5-frontend-wallet]

Services Involved:
- database: PostgreSQL with Supabase, handles wallet tables, booking extensions, RLS policies
- app: Next.js frontend with server actions, handles all business logic and UI

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Parallel groups:
  - phase-4-frontend-checkout + phase-5-frontend-wallet (different UI components, can be built in parallel)
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallelism note: Limited parallelism due to phase dependencies - sequential execution is safer

Key Discoveries from Investigation:
- No existing wallet/balance system - must create from scratch
- No check-in/check-out functionality exists
- Existing transaction table only tracks payment/refund, not balance management
- All tables use RLS with auth.uid() for security
- Server actions pattern: "use server" + {success, error?, data?} return type

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  npm run dev

Or run the init script:

  bash .auto-claude/specs/017-job-completion-payment-release/init.sh

Session 2 (2025-02-22):
- Subtask 1-1 COMPLETED: Created migration for wallet tables and booking completion fields
  - File: supabase/migrations/20260222_add_job_completion_payment_schema.sql
  - Added: wallets table, wallet_transactions table, disputes table
  - Added: booking completion fields (checkout_time, payment_status, review_deadline)
  - Added: helper function ensure_wallet_exists
  - Added: triggers for updated_at on wallets and disputes tables
  - Committed: f0b8412

=== END SESSION 2 ===

Session 3 (2026-02-22):
- Subtask 1-2 COMPLETED: Created RLS policies for wallet tables and payment operations
  - File: supabase/migrations/20260222_add_payment_rls_policies.sql
  - Added: RLS policies for wallets table (user access + admin access)
  - Added: RLS policies for wallet_transactions table (view own transactions)
  - Added: RLS policies for disputes table (worker/business access for bookings)
  - Added: security helper function is_wallet_owner()
  - Committed: 598075b

Session 4 (2026-02-22):
- Subtask 2-1 COMPLETED: Wallet query functions verified and documented
  - File: lib/supabase/queries/wallets.ts (already existed)
  - Verified: All required functions present and follow patterns
  - Functions: getWalletBalance, createWallet, getWalletTransactions,
               getWalletByUserId, getOrCreateWallet, updateWalletBalance,
               addPendingFunds, releaseFunds, deductAvailableFunds,
               getUserWalletTransactions, createWalletTransaction,
               getTransactionsByBookingId, updateTransactionStatus
  - Pattern compliance: Follows bookings.ts pattern with proper error handling,
                        type definitions, JSDoc comments, and return types
  - No code changes needed - implementation was already complete
  - Committed: (verification only commit)

=== END SESSION 4 ===

Session 5 (2026-02-22):
- Subtask 2-2 COMPLETED: Created wallet server actions
  - File: lib/actions/wallets.ts (new file)
  - Functions created:
    * createWalletAction: Creates a new wallet for a user
    * getWalletBalanceAction: Gets pending and available balance
    * getOrCreateWalletAction: Gets existing wallet or creates new one
    * addPendingFundsAction: Adds funds to pending balance (on job completion)
    * releaseFundsAction: Releases funds from pending to available (after review)
    * deductAvailableFundsAction: Deducts funds for withdrawals
    * getWalletTransactionsAction: Gets transaction history
    * getWalletDetailsAction: Gets full wallet details
  - All functions follow {success, error?, data?} return pattern
  - Uses Indonesian error messages consistent with codebase patterns
  - TypeScript type check: No errors for this file
  - Committed: 4d52824
