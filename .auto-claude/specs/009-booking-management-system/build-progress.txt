=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Booking Management System
Workspace: managed by orchestrator
Started: 2026-02-22

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Multi-step feature implementation requiring database schema changes, data fetching hooks, UI components, and realtime integration. The phases follow dependency order: database -> data layer -> UI -> actions -> realtime -> integration.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Created context.json
- Created project_index.json
- Created init.sh
- Phases: 7
- Total subtasks: 17

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Database Schema Setup): 2 subtasks, depends on []
- Phase 2 (Data Layer & Hooks): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-1-database]
- Phase 3 (UI Components): 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-2-data-layer]
- Phase 4 (Page Implementation): 1 subtask, depends on [phase-3-ui-components]
- Phase 5 (Realtime Integration): 2 subtasks, depends on [phase-4-page-implementation]
- Phase 6 (Notifications): 2 subtasks, depends on [phase-4-page-implementation]
- Phase 7 (Integration & Testing): 1 subtask, depends on [phase-5-realtime, phase-6-notifications]

Services Involved:
- Frontend (Next.js 14+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui)
- Database (PostgreSQL via Supabase)

Files to Create:
- supabase/migrations/20250222000000_add_booking_notes.sql
- lib/supabase/queries/bookings.ts
- lib/hooks/use-bookings.ts
- lib/hooks/use-realtime-bookings.ts
- components/booking/worker-application-card.tsx
- components/booking/booking-actions.tsx
- components/booking/bulk-actions.tsx
- components/booking/worker-notes-dialog.tsx

Files to Modify:
- lib/supabase/types.ts (add booking_notes field)
- app/app/(dashboard)/business/jobs/page.tsx (implement booking management UI)

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Parallel groups: [phase-5-realtime, phase-6-notifications] can run in parallel
- Recommended workers: 1
- Sequential execution recommended due to tight dependencies

Key Features:
1. View applications for business jobs
2. Worker profile cards with reliability scores (calculated from reviews)
3. Accept/reject individual bookings
4. Bulk accept/reject multiple workers
5. Worker notes for reference
6. Real-time updates via Supabase Realtime
7. Notifications to workers on status changes

Database Schema Notes:
- bookings table needs booking_notes column (text, nullable)
- reliability_score calculated from reviews table (average rating per worker)
- notifications table used for worker notifications

Tech Stack:
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (Radix UI)
- Supabase (Auth, Database, Realtime)
- React Hook Form + Zod
- Sonner for toast notifications

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  npm run dev

Then open the booking management page at:
  http://localhost:3000/dashboard-business-jobs

Session 2 (Coder - subtask-2-1):
[COMPLETED] subtask-2-1: Create booking query functions (fetch, update status, add notes)
  - Created: lib/supabase/queries/bookings.ts
  - Functions implemented:
    * getJobBookings(jobId) - Fetch all bookings for a specific job with worker and business details
    * getWorkerBookings(workerId) - Fetch bookings for a worker with job and business details
    * getBusinessBookings(businessId) - Fetch bookings for a business with worker and job details
    * getBookingById(bookingId) - Fetch single booking with all related data
    * updateBookingStatus(bookingId, status) - Update single booking status
    * updateMultipleBookingStatuses(bookingIds, status) - Bulk update booking statuses
    * addBookingNotes(bookingId, notes) - Add/update booking notes
    * createBooking(booking) - Create new booking
    * deleteBooking(bookingId) - Delete booking
  - All functions follow project patterns with proper error handling
  - Verification passed

=== END SESSION 2 ===

Session 3 (Coder - subtask-2-2):
[COMPLETED] subtask-2-2: Create useBookings hook for fetching and managing booking state
