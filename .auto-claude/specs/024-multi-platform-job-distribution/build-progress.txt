=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Multi-Platform Job Distribution
Workspace: managed by orchestrator
Started: 2026-02-24

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: This is a multi-service feature requiring database schema changes, backend API development (edge functions), and frontend UI components. The workflow follows the standard feature pattern: Database → Backend → Frontend → Integration.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Created project_index.json
- Created context.json
- Created init.sh
- Phases: 5
- Total subtasks: 25

=== PHASE SUMMARY ===

Phase 1: Database Schema (5 subtasks)
- Create social_platforms table with platform types and configuration
- Create business_social_connections table for OAuth tokens and settings
- Create job_posts table to track social media posts for each job
- Add platform_settings column to jobs table for per-job overrides
- Generate TypeScript types from updated database schema
Dependencies: None

Phase 2: Backend Edge Functions (5 subtasks)
- Create social-connect edge function for OAuth flow (Instagram/Facebook)
- Create social-instagram edge function for posting to Instagram Graph API
- Create social-facebook edge function for posting to Facebook Graph API
- Create social-distribute edge function for orchestrating multi-platform posting
- Create social-webhook edge function for handling platform webhook callbacks
Dependencies: Phase 1 (Database Schema)

Phase 3: Frontend Types & Utilities (3 subtasks)
- Create social platform TypeScript types
- Create social platform server actions (connect, disconnect, list)
- Create content formatter utilities for Instagram and Facebook posts
Dependencies: Phase 1 (Database Schema)
Note: Can run in parallel with Phase 2

Phase 4: Frontend UI Components (5 subtasks)
- Create SocialPlatformConnect component for OAuth connection UI
- Create SocialPostPreview component for previewing formatted posts
- Create SocialPlatformSettings component for per-platform toggles
- Integrate social platform components into job posting form
- Create social performance analytics page component
Dependencies: Phase 2 (Backend) and Phase 3 (Types)

Phase 5: Integration & Testing (5 subtasks)
- Add environment variables for Instagram and Facebook API credentials
- Create database trigger for auto-distribution on job creation
- End-to-end test: Create job and verify social distribution
- Create Supabase function for webhook signature verification
- Update documentation with social platform setup instructions
Dependencies: Phase 2, 3, 4 (all previous phases)

=== SERVICES INVOLVED ===

Database (PostgreSQL via Supabase):
- New tables: social_platforms, business_social_connections, job_posts
- Modify: jobs table (add platform_settings column)
- Triggers: auto-distribute on job creation

Edge Functions (Deno via Supabase):
- social-connect: OAuth flow handler
- social-instagram: Instagram Graph API integration
- social-facebook: Facebook Graph API integration
- social-distribute: Multi-platform orchestration
- social-webhook: Webhook signature verification and callback handling

Frontend (Next.js):
- New types: lib/types/social.ts
- New actions: lib/actions/social.ts
- New utilities: lib/utils/social-content.ts
- New components: social-platform-connect, social-post-preview, social-platform-settings
- Modified: job-posting-form, business jobs page
- New page: business/analytics

=== PARALLELISM ANALYSIS ===

Max parallel phases: 2
Parallel groups:
- Phase 3 (Frontend Types) can run in parallel with Phase 2 (Backend Edge Functions)
  Both depend only on Phase 1 (Database) and don't modify overlapping files

Recommended workers: 1
Reasoning: Sequential execution preferred due to tight dependencies between backend and frontend UI phases. Only one parallel opportunity exists (Phase 2 + Phase 3).

=== INVESTIGATION FINDINGS ===

Project Type: Single-service Next.js application with Supabase backend

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions with Deno)
- Payment: Xendit (already integrated)
- Forms: react-hook-form with zod validation

Existing Patterns Found:
1. Edge Functions follow reliability-score pattern:
   - Deno runtime with 'serve' from https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts
   - CORS headers for browser requests
   - createClient from @supabase/supabase-js@2.38.4
   - Environment variables via Deno.env.get()
   - JSON request/response with error handling

2. Server Actions pattern:
   - "use server" directive at top
   - createClient from lib/supabase/server.ts
   - Return { success: boolean, error?: string, data?: T }

3. Database pattern:
   - UUID primary keys with uuid_generate_v4()
   - timestamptz defaults with NOW()
   - RLS policies in separate migration files
   - Naming convention: YYYYMMDDhhmmss_description.sql

4. Form component pattern:
   - react-hook-form with zodResolver
   - Radix UI components (shadcn/ui)
   - Local storage for draft data
   - onSubmit callback prop

Files to Reference:
- supabase/functions/reliability-score/index.ts (edge function pattern)
- app/components/job-posting-form.tsx (form component pattern)
- lib/api/jobs.ts (API query pattern)
- lib/supabase/queries/jobs.ts (database query pattern)
- supabase/migrations/20250222000001_initial_schema.sql (schema pattern)

Business Context:
From docs/analysis-bali-daily-worker-social-media.md:
- Instagram and Facebook are PRIMARY platforms for hospitality job postings in Bali
- 70% of jobs are filled through social media and word-of-mouth
- Key hashtags: #BaliJobs, #LowonganKerjaBali, #BaliHospitality
- Multi-platform distribution is a Phase 3 feature (per PRD.md)

=== VERIFICATION STRATEGY ===

Risk Level: HIGH
Reasoning:
- Third-party API integrations (Instagram/Facebook) which can fail
- OAuth security requirements
- Potential for exposed credentials in client code
- Complex multi-service coordination

Test Types Required: unit, integration, e2e
Security Scanning Required: Yes
Staging Deployment Required: Yes

Acceptance Criteria:
- All database migrations apply successfully
- Edge functions deploy without errors
- OAuth flow works for Instagram and Facebook
- Jobs auto-distribute to connected platforms
- Post preview displays correctly
- Performance analytics show engagement metrics
- No sensitive tokens exposed in client code

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 024 --parallel 1
