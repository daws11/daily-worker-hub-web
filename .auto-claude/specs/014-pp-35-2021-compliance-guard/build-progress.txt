# Build Progress - PP 35/2021 Compliance Guard

## Subtask 1-1: Create compliance_tracking table ✅ COMPLETED
- File: supabase/migrations/20260222_add_compliance_tracking.sql
- Status: COMPLETE - Migration file already exists with proper implementation
- Schema Verified:
  - id (UUID primary key with gen_random_uuid())
  - business_id (FK → businesses.id ON DELETE CASCADE)
  - worker_id (FK → workers.id ON DELETE CASCADE)
  - month (DATE - first day of month)
  - days_worked (INTEGER >= 0, DEFAULT 0)
  - created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
  - updated_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- Indexes Created:
  - idx_compliance_tracking_business_id
  - idx_compliance_tracking_worker_id
  - idx_compliance_tracking_month
  - idx_compliance_tracking_business_worker_month (composite)
- Constraints:
  - UNIQUE(business_id, worker_id, month)
  - CHECK (days_worked >= 0)
- RLS Policies:
  - "Businesses can view own compliance tracking" (SELECT)
  - "Workers can view own compliance tracking" (SELECT)
  - "Admins can view all compliance tracking data" (SELECT)
  - "Authenticated users can insert compliance tracking data" (INSERT)
  - "Authenticated users can update compliance tracking data" (UPDATE)
- Trigger: set_compliance_tracking_updated_at (auto-updates updated_at)

## Subtask 1-2: Create calculate_days_worked function ✅ COMPLETED
- File: supabase/migrations/20260222_add_compliance_tracking.sql
- Status: COMPLETE - Function implemented following project patterns
- Function: calculate_days_worked(p_business_id, p_worker_id, p_month)
  - Returns: INTEGER (count of accepted/completed bookings in specified month)
  - Logic: Counts bookings where status IN ('accepted', 'completed') and start_date within month
  - Error Handling: Returns 0 on failure with RAISE WARNING
  - Uses: SECURITY DEFINER for proper permissions
  - Documentation: COMMENT added describing purpose and usage

## Subtask 1-3: Create trigger for automatic compliance_tracking updates ✅ COMPLETED
- File: supabase/migrations/20260222_add_compliance_tracking.sql
- Status: COMPLETE - Trigger implemented following project patterns
- Function: update_compliance_tracking_for_booking()
  - Trigger: AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON bookings
  - Logic:
    - Fires when booking status changes to 'accepted' or 'completed'
    - Calculates month from start_date (fallback to created_at)
    - Calls calculate_days_worked() to get current count
    - Upserts into compliance_tracking using ON CONFLICT
  - Error Handling: Returns NEW/OLD to prevent booking failures
  - Documentation: COMMENT added for function and trigger
- Trigger Name: on_booking_status_change_for_compliance
