=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Reliability Score Calculation System
Workspace: /Users/yanuar/Documents/daws/daily-worker-hub-web/.auto-claude/worktrees/tasks/015-reliability-score-calculation
Started: 2026-02-22

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Building a new multi-service feature with clear service dependencies.
           Database schema changes must come first, followed by backend logic,
           then UI components.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Created project_index.json
- Created context.json
- Created init.sh
- Created build-progress.txt

=== FEATURE OVERVIEW ===

Automated reliability scoring system that calculates worker scores (1-5 stars)
based on three weighted factors:
  • 40% Attendance Rate: completed_bookings / total_bookings
  • 30% Punctuality Rate: on-time arrivals / total completed jobs
  • 30% Average Ratings: from business reviews

=== PHASE SUMMARY ===

Phase 1: Database Schema Changes (4 subtasks)
  - Add actual_start_time, actual_end_time to bookings (for punctuality)
  - Create reliability_score_history table (for trend tracking)
  - Add RLS policies for score history
  - Regenerate TypeScript types

Phase 2: Backend Logic (3 subtasks)
  - Update reliability-score edge function with 40/30/30 formula
  - Create database query functions
  - Create server actions for score calculation

Phase 3: UI Components (3 subtasks)
  - Create ReliabilityBadge component (star display)
  - Create ScoreBreakdown component (transparent metrics)
  - Create ScoreHistory component (trend visualization)

Phase 4: Integration Pages (2 subtasks)
  - Add score display to worker profile page
  - Add score display to business applicant view

Phase 5: Automation Triggers (3 subtasks)
  - Create database trigger for auto-calculation
  - Add calculation to job completion flow
  - End-to-end verification

=== SERVICES INVOLVED ===

  • database: PostgreSQL schema changes, migrations
  • edge_functions: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno)
  • queries: Database query functions (TypeScript)
  • actions: Next.js server actions
  • frontend: React components and pages

=== PARALLELISM ANALYSIS ===

Max parallel phases: 2 (UI components and integration pages can overlap)
Recommended workers: 1 (Sequential execution recommended due to dependencies)

=== DISCOVERY NOTES ===

1. Existing Implementation Found:
   - File: supabase/functions/reliability-score/index.ts
   - Status: Uses wrong formula (50/50), update code commented out
   - Action: Update with 40/30/30 formula and enable updates

2. Database Schema:
   - Workers table already has reliability_score column (number type)
   - Bookings table has start_date/end_date but needs actual times for punctuality
   - Reviews table exists for ratings
   - No reliability_score_history table yet

3. Code Patterns:
   - Server actions: "use server", return {success, error?, data?}
   - Edge functions: Deno.serve(), CORS headers, service role key
   - Components: "use client", lucide-react icons, sonner toasts
   - Types: Auto-generated in lib/supabase/types.ts

4. Tech Stack:
   - Next.js 14 (App Router)
   - TypeScript
   - Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
   - Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Edge Functions)

=== ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA ===

  [ ] Reliability scores calculate automatically after job completion
  [ ] Score formula: 40% attendance + 30% punctuality + 30% ratings
  [ ] Scores range from 1.0 to 5.0 stars
  [ ] Score history is tracked in reliability_score_history table
  [ ] Workers with <5 completed jobs show "Insufficient data"
  [ ] Score breakdown is transparent in worker profile
  [ ] Businesses can see worker reliability scores when hiring

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  cd /Users/yanuar/Documents/daws/daily-worker-hub-web/.auto-claude/worktrees/tasks/015-reliability-score-calculation
  npm run dev

Or use the init script:

  source .auto-claude/specs/015-reliability-score-calculation/init.sh

=== VERIFICATION STRATEGY ===

Risk Level: medium

Required Verification:
  1. Type Check: npm run type-check
  2. Build: npm run build
  3. Manual UI: Check worker profile page
  4. Database: Verify new columns and tables

Manual Testing Required:
  - Job completion -> score calculation flow
  - Worker profile score display
  - Business applicant view scores

=== END SESSION 1 ===

Session Type: Planning
Files Created:
  • implementation_plan.json (5 phases, 14 subtasks)
  • project_index.json (service and infrastructure info)
  • context.json (patterns and existing implementations)
  • init.sh (development environment setup)
  • build-progress.txt (this file)

Next Session: Implementation (Coder Agent)
  - Begin with Phase 1, Subtask 1-1: Add booking time tracking columns
  - Follow subtask order respecting dependencies
  - Mark each subtask complete after verification

=== SESSION 2: IMPLEMENTATION STARTED ===

Date: 2026-02-22

[COMPLETED] Subtask 1-1: Add actual_start_time and actual_end_time columns to bookings table
  • Created: supabase/migrations/20260222_add_booking_time_tracking.sql
  • Added columns: actual_start_time TIMESTAMPTZ, actual_end_time TIMESTAMPTZ
  • Added indexes for efficient querying
  • Added documentation comments
  • Commit: 1c22935
  • Plan updated: subtask-1-1 status = completed

[IN PROGRESS] Subtask 1-2: Create reliability_score_history table
  • Next: Create migration file for reliability_score_history table
